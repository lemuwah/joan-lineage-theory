# Archivist — KPW Source Map
**Date:** 2026-07-15
**Agent:** Archivist
**Task source:** research_queue/2026-07-11_expand_kpw_search.md (requested, never delivered until now)
**Governing laws:** Four Laws now in force (see theory/three_laws.md)

---

## 1. Target Files Reviewed

- `agents/explorer/2026-07-11_kpw_hypotheses.md` and the companion Kimi-generated
  `agents/explorer/kimi test v1_2026-07-11_kpw_hypotheses.md` (8 hypotheses, H1–H8)
- `theory/source_spine.md` (current claim/status ledger)
- `/sources/` (actual retained source holdings)
- `/primary_sources/` (published primary-source pages)

## 2. ⚠️ Priority Finding — Two "PROVEN" Anchors Have No Retained Source Copy

Before mapping the KPW hypotheses, a more urgent gap surfaced while cross-checking
what's actually in `/sources/` against what `source_spine.md` and the site cite as
🟢 PROVEN:

- **Hough 1858** (court-martial records, pp.173–191) is cited as the source for
  🟢 PROVEN claims — the Aug 24, 1676 court-martial fracture (Daniel testifying
  against Anastaiawin while John Sr. denies) and the Anaftiawin 8th-variant naming.
  **There is no Hough 1858 file anywhere in `/sources/` or `/primary_sources/`.** The
  site links directly to an archive.org scan instead of a retained local copy. Open
  thread #5 explicitly says this retrieval is "currently incomplete." **This means
  some content currently marked 🟢 PROVEN rests on a source the project has not
  actually pulled a citable, page-checked copy of yet** — the specific pp.173–191
  passage has been summarized/quoted in theory files without a transcript anyone
  can point to and verify line-by-line.
- **Bates 1918–19 (RIHS Collections XI–XII)** — cited as 🟢 PROVEN for John Greene
  Sr.'s death before 25 Sept 1685, and source_spine.md even states "Bates 1918–19
  obtained and read." **There is no Bates file in `/sources/` either.** "Obtained and
  read" appears to mean read externally (library/archive.org/HathiTrust), not
  retained. `sources/source_intake_queue.md` §1.2 still lists Bates as
  `File: (your uploaded filename)` — a template placeholder that was never filled in.

**Recommendation:** this doesn't necessarily mean the 🟢 status is wrong — but per
Law 4 (No Algorithmic Contamination) and general evidentiary discipline, a claim this
load-bearing (it's the anchor that closed the project's "single highest-priority
structural gap") should have a retained, citable copy in `/sources/`, not just a
memory of having read it. Suggest downgrading to 🟡 PROBABLE-pending-retrieval for
any claim that rests *solely* on Hough or Bates until a copy is actually filed, OR
explicitly documenting in `source_spine.md` that these are externally-verified,
not-locally-held sources (a legitimate but different evidentiary category than the
other 🟢 anchors, which mostly do have local scans in `/images/` or `/sources/`).

## 3. KPW Hypothesis → Source Map

| Hypothesis | What it needs | What's actually in `/sources/` | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 (militia/household involvement) | Warwick militia letters, Cowesett/Pawtuxet correspondence | Nothing found. `pawtucket fight names` (image) may be tangentially relevant — untranscribed. | ⚪ NEEDS OCR |
| H2 (Daniel² court-martial bridge) | Hough 1858 pp.173–191 full transcription | **Not held** — see §2 above. | 🔴 BLOCKED |
| H3 (war-orphan/captive household) | Bartlett Vols. 2–3, Greene probate inventories | Nothing found in `/sources/`. No probate files present at all. | ⚪ UNSTARTED |
| H4 (post-war land reallocation matriline) | Pawtuxet Records pre-1675 deed chain, Fones 1703 entry marginalia | `fones.pdf` is held; `transcription of 1672 with addendum for succession` (image) may be relevant but untranscribed. Pre-1675 Pawtuxet chain not found. | 🟡 PARTIAL |
| H5 (war-refugee safe-house) | Warwick militia rolls, church charity logs | Nothing found. | ⚪ UNSTARTED |
| H6 (Anaftiawin wartime alias) | Hough 1858 pp.173–191 | **Not held** — same blocker as H2. | 🔴 BLOCKED |
| H7 (Bartlett captive-Greene connection) | Bartlett Vols. 2–3 | Nothing found — this is the explicit "slave-trade test" from open thread #6, still untouched. | ⚪ UNSTARTED |
| H8 (burned-Providence shadow) | Newport court records, East Greenwich records, colonial correspondence | `records of proprietor LB Simmons transcript` and `records of proprietor with names` (both images, untranscribed) may be partially relevant. | 🟡 PARTIAL |

**Bottom line: two of the Explorer's eight hypotheses (H2, H6) cannot be evaluated at
all without the single most-blocked source in the project (Hough 1858 pp.173–191).
Two more (H3, H7) point at a source that hasn't been searched even once (Bartlett).**
This matches — and confirms — what `source_spine.md` open threads #5 and #6 already
flagged as CRITICAL/HIGH priority; the KPW expansion cycle doesn't change that
priority ranking, it just shows four of eight new hypotheses are gated behind it.

## 4. Inference-Only Claims Surfaced

- The claim that Hough 1858's court-martial fracture (Daniel vs. father) is a
  "kinship bond" and not "policy disagreement" (source_spine.md, behavioral anomaly
  #1) is an *interpretation* of a transcription the project doesn't have a full copy
  of. This is inference stacked on an unretrieved source — flag as double-fragile.
- `theory/john_greene_origins.md`'s entire migration timeline (1628 dispossession →
  1635 emigration → 1639 Rhode Island) has no source file anywhere in `/sources/` or
  `/primary_sources/`. It is currently pure narrative with no retained citation at all
  — not even an external link. This is the weakest-sourced claim in the whole project
  right now.

## 5. Good News — One Real Source Match Found

**`sources/potter history of narr.pdf` is already held** and is exactly the source
newly-added open thread #9 (Coginiquant/Cogineaquon/Cononjonant name-cluster, marked
CRITICAL) calls for ("read Potter's Atherton Purchase ~pp. 58-60"). This is
low-hanging fruit — the source is sitting in the repo already; it just hasn't been
opened and read against that specific question yet.

## 6. Missing Evidence — Consolidated

1. Hough 1858 pp.173–191 — full local transcription (blocks H2, H6; open thread #5).
2. Bartlett Vols. 2–3 — not searched at all (blocks H3, H7; open thread #6).
3. Any probate inventory for any Greene family member — zero currently held.
4. Any source at all for the John Greene Origins DNA/migration thesis.
5. A retained copy of Bates 1918–19, even though it's already been "read."

## 7. Suggested Next Steps

1. **Highest priority:** retrieve and transcribe Hough 1858 pp.173–191 in full —
   this single action unblocks two Explorer hypotheses and resolves the biggest
   PROVEN-but-unretained gap in the project.
2. Read `sources/potter history of narr.pdf` pp.58–60 against open thread #9 — the
   source is already in hand, this is a same-day task.
3. Begin the Bartlett Vols. 2–3 search (open thread #6 / H3 / H7) — currently the
   single most-cited-but-never-searched source in the entire project.
4. File a real source (or explicitly mark as unsourced narrative) for
   `theory/john_greene_origins.md` before any Hostile Review of it proceeds.
5. Either upload retained copies of Hough 1858 and Bates 1918–19 to `/sources/`, or
   formally document in `source_spine.md` that these two anchors are
   externally-verified rather than locally held — right now the project is silent
   about which category they're in, which is itself a Law 4 (documentation
   transparency) gap.
